//* Facade Pattern
//** Instead of exposing an interface with complex functionality to the client. We can hide the complex API behind a client friendly interface
//** Expose only the functionality which client actually needs. ie Hiding a complex 3rd party interface behind a Facade interface

    public static void main(String[] args){
